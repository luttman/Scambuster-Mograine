Getting Started

This addon packages realm data on scammers to be used with the Scambuster addon framework. As such, it requires both addons to work. Once you install Scambuster Golemagg alongside Scambuster, the game will alert you in real-time whenever you encounter a scammer. To access the configuration options type /scambuster into the chat panel or open it via the interface addon menu.
